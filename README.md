# EveShopper

Welcome to EveShopper, the app for creating a shopping cart for EVE Online! Currently it gets market groups by ID (as a test), But soon it will:

- Get items by name
- Display the prices of the item in certain regions (you will be able to select "Caldari" for example to get all prices in Caldari space) and the description of the item
- Export your list to the clipboard so you can paste it into EVE!

Modules are not included, please use `npm install` to install them.

This currently uses Electron `v4.1.0`, Axios `v0.18.0`, and NodeJS `v10.15.3`.
